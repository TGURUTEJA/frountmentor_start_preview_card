### What I learned

In this challenge I learned how to overlay a colour over a image

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
section{
    width: 50%;
    height: 100%;
    background-image: url(./images/image-header-desktop.jpg);
    background-size: cover;
    position: relative;
    float: right;
    margin-left: 0px;
    
}
.image{
    position: absolute;
    top:0;
    left:0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    background: rgba(162, 69, 219, 0.7);;

}
```
